The present site allows you to:
- Insert a title for each partecipant
  - Validate the title through Blockchain (automatically)
  - Search for a certain title (by using the corresponding hash)
## Are you an admin?
- Just press the "ADD TITLE" button and enter credentials.
  - A warning message will appear at the top left if your IP is different with respect to your previous (is any) access
  - Then create a new post and fill all fields except for hash and txId: they'll be filled automatically
## Are you a user?
You can:  
- See all the title posted
- If you know the unique identifier (i.e. the hash)
  - Click on the "SEARCH" button
  - Insert the hash
  - If the corresponding title exists, you will see all info about that title
